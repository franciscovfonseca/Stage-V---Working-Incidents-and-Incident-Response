<h1 align="center">Stage III - Working Incidents & Incident Response</h1>

<br>

<br>

In this lab we're gong to **Investigate and Work the Incidents** being generated within **Microsoft Sentinel**.

We'll do this in accordance with the [NIST 800-61](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/specialpublications/nist.sp.800-61r2.pdf) **Incident Management Lifecycle**.

<br />
<br />

## Step 1: Preparation

We've completed this step already by:

- Setting Up Logging for all of our Resources

- Ingesting all of the Logs into the Log Analytics Workspace

- Configuring Microsoft Sentinel & Alert Rules.

<br>

## Step 2: Detection & Analysis

<br>

> **<summary> 📝 Explanation</summary>**
> 
> This phase gets kicked off when someone notices some kind of **Anomaly in the System**.
> 
> In our case we configured a bunch of Alerts ➜ and the fact that an **Incident was Created** ➜ is the beggining of our **Detection Phase**.
> 
>   </details>

<br>

1. Set Severity, Status, Owner

2. View Full Details

3. Observe the Activity Log

4. Observe Entities and Incident Timelines

5. “Investigate” the incident and continue trying to determine the scope

6. Inspect the entities and see if there are any related events

7. Determine legitimacy of the incident

8. If True Positive, continue, if False positive, close it out

<br>

## Step 3: Containment, Eradication, and Recovery

Use this simple Incident Response PlayBook to remediate the incident.

<br>

## Step 4: Post-Incident Activity

Document Findings and Close out the Incident in Sentinel

Go to **Microsoft Sentinel** ➜ select our Log Analytics Workspace ```LAW-Cyber-Lab``` that is associated with this Sentinel Instance.

Click on the **Workbooks** blade ➜ and then ➕ **Add Workbook**

**<summary> 📝 Step-by-step Guide on How to Create the Sentinel Maps Inside the Workbooks?</summary>**

<br>

We'll first create the **Workbook** & the **Map** for the ***Linux SSH Authentication Failures***

After clicking on ➕ **Add Workbook** ➜ you can see there's a Default Workbook that Sentinel made.

Click ✏️ **Edit**

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d44e9cd-77b8-41f4-93a7-2067a752e545)

<br>

There's 2 Elements in the default workbook ➜ so we'll 🗑️ **Remove** them both

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/343aafd9-44d7-4b59-bcda-b031db117d2b)

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/202e60b2-e41e-4278-a423-c2b64b411707)

<br>

Then we're going to click on ➕ **Add** ➜ and we're going to 𝄜 **Add query** based element

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ab29302-b055-44cb-ba8e-7cb881f5b0c7)

<br>

We'll then click the **</> Advanced Editor blade**

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d413801a-f244-417b-b0e1-98123d4fc183)

<br>

Now go to [this GitHub link](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/Cyber-Course-v2/blob/main/Sentinel-Maps(JSON)/linux-ssh-auth-fail.json) to get the **JSON** for the **Linux SSH Failed Authentication Map**.

Copy the **JSON** text.

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3af9386-d113-4c36-ac3f-02f2729f170a)

<br>

Back in the Azure Portal ➜ erase the default text ➜ and paste the **JSON** from the GitHub link

Then click ✔️ **Done Editing** down bellow

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17ab1229-7a1b-46d8-bc07-a5eb7fa9069e)

<br>

Lastly, we'll click on the 💾 **Save** button:

- **Name the Workbook** ➜ ```linux-ssh-auth-fail```

- Make sure you select our **Log Analytics Workspace** ➜ ```LAW-Cyber-Lab```

- Place the Workbook at he same **Location** as our other Resources ➜ ```(US) East US```

Click **"Apply"**

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da6e470e-b63b-401d-8b97-c9d2883ad25a)

<br>

✅ The **Workbook** and the corresponding **Sentinel Map** for the **Linux SSH Authentication Failures** were successfuully created.

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63f4d693-f9a9-44b1-99cd-70b408a5b8a1)

<br>

We'll then continue creating the rest of the Workbooks & Maps for the rest of the Resources.

We'll click on ➕ **Add Workbook** ➜ follow the same process ➜  and use the other JSON codes from [this GitHub link](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/Cyber-Course-v2/tree/main/Sentinel-Maps(JSON))

<br>

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c976a36-0991-4679-aea1-22588d9b24f6)

<br>

We'll then go to our Log Analytics Workspace ```LAW-Cyber-Lab``` ➜ and **Paste It** to **Query the Logs**

<br>

<br>

For example ➜ this is the Query from the **Microsoft SQL Server Failed Authentication** Workbook in LAW:

By doing this, you can test changes to the Query.

✅ This way we make sure it's **Working and Generating Desired Results** ➜ before having to Update the Sentinel Workbooks.

<br>

To test your alerts and incidents rule configuration ➜ simulate some attacks on the VMs and see if they show up in Sentinel (generate alerts and incidents).

⚠️ We have to make sure these work before the first observation period.

<br>

Here are some Tests to Run:

<br>

#### ❶ Trigger AAD Brute Force Success:

- Simulate brute force success against Azure AD with your attacker account (from attack-vm).

- Either use PowerShell or an incognito window to fail 10-11 consecutive logins, followed by one successful login.

<br>

<h2></h2>

<br>

#### ❷ Trigger MSSQL Brute Force Attempt:

- We'll use the ```attack-vm``` for this one.

- Use ***PowerShell*** or ***SSMS*** to simulate **Brute Force Attempt against your SQL Server** by failing 10 Consecutive Logins.

<br>

<h2></h2>

<br>

#### ❸ Trigger Malware Outbreak:

- In ```windows-vm``` generate a **Malware Alert** by using ***PowerShell*** to create 1 or more **EICAR Files**.

- 💡 You can also do this Manually by creating a Text File with an **EICAR String** in it.

<br>

<h2></h2>

<br>

#### ❹ Trigger Possible Privilege Escalation (AKV Critical Credential Retrieval or Update):

- Manually read our **Key Vault Secret** ```Tenant-Global-Admin-Password``` in the Azure portal.

<br>

<h2></h2>

<br>

#### ❺ Trigger Windows Host Firewall Tampering:

- Manually Enable & Disable the ```windows-vm``` **Firewall**.

<br>

<h2></h2>

<br>

#### ❻ Trigger Excessive Password Resets:

- Reset a **User's Password** in the Azure portal 10 times.

<br>

<h2></h2>

<br>

After each attach, wait 10-20 minutes ➜ then check Sentinel to see if you have any incidents.
