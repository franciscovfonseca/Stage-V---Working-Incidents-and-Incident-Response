<h1 align="center">Stage III - Working Incidents & Incident Response</h1>

<br>

<br>

In this lab we're gong to **Investigate and Work the Incidents** being generated within **Microsoft Sentinel**.

We'll do this in accordance with the [**NIST 800-61**](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/specialpublications/nist.sp.800-61r2.pdf) **Incident Management Lifecycle**.

<summary> <h2>‚û°Ô∏è 4 Step Incident Response Guidance / Guidelines</h2> </summary>
<br>

## Step ‚ûÄ ‚ûú Preparation

We've completed this step already by:

- Setting Up **Logging** for all of our Resources.

- **Ingesting all of the Logs** into the **Log Analytics Workspace**.

- Configuring **Microsoft Sentinel** & **Alert Rules**.

<br>

<br>

## Step ‚ûÅ ‚ûú Detection & Analysis

<br>

>   
> **<summary> üìù Explanation</summary>**
> 
> This phase gets kicked off when someone notices some kind of **Anomaly in the System**.
> 
> In our case we configured a bunch of Alerts ‚ûú and the fact that an **Incident was Created** ‚ûú is the beggining of our **Detection Phase**.
> 
>   </details>

<br>

**1Ô∏è‚É£** Set the **Severity**, the **Status** & the **Owner** of the Incident.

**2Ô∏è‚É£** **View Full Details**.

**3Ô∏è‚É£** Observe the **Activity Log** (for the History of the Incident).

**4Ô∏è‚É£** Observe the **Entities** & **Incident Timeline**.

**5Ô∏è‚É£** **Investigate the Incident** and continue trying to **Determine the Scope**.

**6Ô∏è‚É£** **Inspect the Entities** and see if there are any **Related Events**.

**7Ô∏è‚É£** **Determine Legitimacy** of the Incident.

**8Ô∏è‚É£** If **True Positive** ‚ûú Continue | If **False Positive** ‚ûú Close it out.

<br>

<br>

## Step ‚ûÇ ‚ûú Containment, Eradication & Recovery

Use this simple [**Incident Response PlayBook**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EQ5MzN95POLaRIMulYg3PIH3UGHtDNcGdkFvgOXyEXQ/edit#heading=h.uyxi3urvol4g) to **Remediate the Incident**.

<br>

<br>

## Step ‚ûÉ ‚ûú Post-Incident Activity

- Document Findings

- Close out the Incident in Sentinel

<br>

<br>

## Initial Response Actions

<br>

‚úî Verify the Authenticity of the Alert or Report.

‚úî Immediately Isolate the Machine and Change the Password of the affected User.

‚úî Identify the Origin of the Attacks and determine if they are attacking or involved with anything else.

‚úî Determine How and When the attack occurred.

‚úî Are the NSGs not being locked down? If so ‚ûú check other NSGs.

‚úî Assess the Potential Impact of the Incident.

‚úî What Type of Account was it? What Permissions did it have?

This is another **False Positive** ‚ùå

It could have been Multiple Login Attempts with the Incorrect Password or MFA Code.

I recognize this IP from work ‚ûú although I'm not entirely sure how 35 events were produced.

Perhaps by restoring multiple browser tabs simultaneously?
  
  - MFA is already Enabled on the User's Account.
 
  - and the Logins occurred from an Expected IP.
